            <p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can be used to add interactivity to websites. One of the most common ways to do this is by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage. The DOM is a representation of the structure of a webpage, and JavaScript can be used to add, remove, and modify elements on the page.</p>

            <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>

            <p id="domID">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.

                The DOM provides a way for programs to interact with the structure of a document, allowing them to add, remove, and modify elements on the page.</p>
